## Documentation Strategy

For each project, I will create:

1. **GitHub Repository** - With clear documentation and code
2. **Project Writeup** - Explaining my approach and implementation details
3. **Demo Videos** - Showing the tools in action
4. **Technical Blog Posts** - Sharing insights and lessons learned

## Success Metrics

Each project will be evaluated based on:

- Functionality (does it work as intended?)
- Code quality (is it well-structured and documented?)
- Security effectiveness (does it actually improve security?)
- Employer relevance (does it demonstrate valuable skills?)
