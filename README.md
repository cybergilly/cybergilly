## Featured Project: KQL Query Generator

### Overview
*Command-line tool for generating KQL (Kusto Query Language) queries from natural language prompts*

**Description:** A Python-based CLI application designed for cybersecurity professionals working with Azure Sentinel, Microsoft Defender, and other KQL-enabled platforms. The tool translates natural language descriptions into properly formatted KQL queries for threat hunting, incident response, and security monitoring.

**Key Features:**
- Interactive query building with step-by-step prompts
- Natural language processing for query generation
- Pre-built templates for common cybersecurity scenarios
- Support for failed login analysis, process monitoring, network traffic analysis
- Export capabilities and customizable parameters

**Technologies:** `Python 3` `KQL` `Azure Sentinel` `Microsoft Defender` `CLI`

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Generate query from natural language
python3 kql_generator.py --prompt "failed logins in the last 24 hours"

# Interactive mode with guided prompts
python3 kql_generator.py --interactive

# Use predefined security templates
python3 kql_generator.py --template suspicious_processes
```

**Sample Output:**
```kql
SigninLogs
| where TimeGenerated >= ago(24h)
| where ResultType != "0"
| project TimeGenerated, UserPrincipalName, IPAddress, Location
| order by TimeGenerated desc
```

**Documentation:** See [KQL_GENERATOR_README.md](KQL_GENERATOR_README.md) for detailed usage instructions.

## Featured Project: Azure GRC Engineering for NIST 800-171

### Overview
*Automated compliance assessment and monitoring tool for NIST SP 800-171 controls*

**Description:** A Python-based compliance automation tool designed for cybersecurity professionals managing NIST 800-171 compliance in Azure environments. This tool helps organizations assess, monitor, and maintain compliance with the 110 security requirements outlined in NIST SP 800-171, specifically focused on protecting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI) in nonfederal systems.

**Key Features:**
- Automated assessment of NIST 800-171 security controls
- Azure-specific compliance checks and recommendations
- Gap analysis and remediation guidance
- Compliance reporting and documentation generation
- Integration with Azure Security Center and Azure Policy
- Control mapping to Azure native security services

**Technologies:** `Python 3` `Azure SDK` `NIST 800-171` `Compliance Automation` `Azure Policy`

**Usage Examples:**
```bash
# Run full NIST 800-171 compliance assessment
python3 nist_800_171_grc.py --assess --output-format json

# Check specific control families
python3 nist_800_171_grc.py --control-family "Access Control" --detailed

# Generate compliance report
python3 nist_800_171_grc.py --report --format pdf
```

**Sample Control Checks:**
- 3.1.1 Access Control: Verify user access reviews and permissions
- 3.4.1 Configuration Management: Validate system hardening standards
- 3.13.1 System Protection: Check malware protection implementation
- 3.14.1 System Integrity: Monitor file integrity and change detection

**Documentation:** See [NIST_800_171_GRC_README.md](NIST_800_171_GRC_README.md) for detailed implementation guide.

- Configure network sensors and log collectors
- Create custom detection rules
- Develop incident response playbooks
- Build automated alerting system

**Technologies:** `Security Onion` `Suricata` `Zeek` `ELK Stack` `Sigma Rules`

**Project Timeline:** 2026

---

### Cloud Security Architecture
*Secure cloud environment design*

**Implementation Plan:**
- Design multi-account architecture
- Implement infrastructure-as-code with security controls
- Create compliance automation
- Deploy centralized logging
- Establish secure CI/CD pipelines

**Technologies:** `AWS` `Terraform` `CloudTrail` `CloudWatch` `Config Rules`

**Project Timeline:** 2026

*This plan outlines my strategy for developing a comprehensive cybersecurity portfolio.*
