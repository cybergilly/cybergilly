# 👋 Hi there, I'm James!

## 🛡️ Cybersecurity Analyst (Learning in Public)

I'm focused on improving my Python skillset and building practical GRC engineering projects. I learn by shipping small, useful tools and documenting what works (and what doesn't).

### 🎯 Focus Right Now

- Building small Python tools that solve real security/GRC problems
- Turning governance and compliance processes into code and automation
- Sharing progress openly to help others on the same path

#### Python skill growth
- Data parsing and normalization (CSV/JSON/YAML, pandas basics)
- APIs and automation (requests, authentication, rate-limits, retries)
- CLI tooling and packaging (argparse/Typer, virtualenv/poetry, publishing)
- Secure coding habits (secrets handling, logging, error handling, tests)
